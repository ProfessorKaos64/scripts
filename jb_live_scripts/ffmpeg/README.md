This git repo is to store various scripts I have made

Installation
=============
Each one of the scripts in this repo directory can be added, piece meal, to your crontab file (crontab -e).  You may adjust the times if you wish, as I have set pre recording times for banter before shows.  Also, each script file will record for 2 hours, which can also be adjusted.  Please contact me for any suggestions or corrections.
