This git repo is to store various scripts I have made

Installation
=============
Each one of the scripts in this repo directory can be added, piece meal, to your crontab file (crontab -e).  You may adjust the times if you wish, as I have set pre recording times for banter before shows.  Also, each script file will record for 2 hours, which can also be adjusted.  Please contact me for any suggestions or corrections.

The folders above denote which capture method I used, and each contain a README.md file, aside from Testing scripts.  This is a work in progress, and should be treated as such.

Bug_Reports
=============
Bug Reports shall be submitterd in the "issues" area link on the right side of this page.  PLEASE be sure to submit detailed system information, as well as the versions of your package you are using.  I will label the bug/issue accordingly.
